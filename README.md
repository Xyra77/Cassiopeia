## 🚀 Features

### 🔐 OPSEC & Anonymity
- Tor + ProxyChains automatic configuration
- MAC address spoofing
- IP rotation during scan
- DNS leak protection
- Real IP masking

### 🔍 Reconnaissance (15+ Phases)
| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | OSINT & Passive Recon (theHarvester, Shodan, GitLeaks) |
| Phase 2 | Subdomain Enumeration (Subfinder, Amass, Assetfinder) |
| Phase 3 | Port & Service Scanning (Masscan, Nmap, testssl.sh) |
| Phase 4 | Fingerprinting & WAF Detection (WhatWeb, WAFW00F) |
| Phase 5 | URL & Parameter Discovery (GAU, Katana, Gospider, Arjun) |
| Phase 6 | Directory Fuzzing (FFUF, Gobuster, Feroxbuster, Nikto) |
| Phase 7 | XSS Hunting (Dalfox, KXSS, CRLFuzz) |
| Phase 8 | SQL Injection (SQLMap automated) |
| Phase 9 | SSRF Detection |
| Phase 10 | LFI / Path Traversal |
| Phase 11 | SSTI / XXE / RCE |
| Phase 12 | CORS / HTTP Smuggling / JWT |
| Phase 13 | GraphQL & API Discovery |
| Phase 14 | Nuclei Vulnerability Scan |
| Phase 15 | Metasploit Automation |

### 🧩 Advanced Addons

2. Verified findings tagged with `X-Cassiopeia-Source: verified-finding`
3. Caido GUI auto-opens at `http://127.0.0.1:7777`
4. Filter by priority in Caido History tab
